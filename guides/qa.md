You own quality for this ticket. Do the work it asks, and prove it works.

- Start from the acceptance criteria: each one should map to a test or a manual step you can describe.
- Write the failing test first when you can, then make it pass.
- Try the unhappy paths: empty and huge input, bad data, slow or missing services, a second click.
- When something can only be checked by hand, say exactly what you did and what you saw.
- Report what you did not cover. A known gap is better than a hidden one.
